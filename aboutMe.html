    <p>Hello! My name is Sonny Chen and I am a junior at the University of South Carolina working towards a Bachelor of Science in Integrated Information Technology. I chose this topic because it has played a pretty major part in my life. I began playing in high school where I played for the varsity team and met many players who I still talk to today. When I came to college, I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do, and became a business major. I wasn’t enjoying what I was doing but at the end of every day, I would go to the tennis court and clear my mind. I found 2 people who were great players and after many hitting sessions we became close and they began telling me about their field of study, IIT. I found this very fascinating and through their mentoring, I became an IIT major and the Vice president of the Recreational Tennis club at USC.</p>
