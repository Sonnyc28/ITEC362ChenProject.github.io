    <h2>The Sport of Tennis</h2>
    <p>Tennis is a sport in which players can play individually against someone else, or with a partner against 2 other players. All players use a racket that is strung with strings made of a variety of materials, sizes, and purposes. They hit a rubber ball covered in a felt material back and forth on a rectangular court, split by a 3 and a half feet high net with the goal of getting the ball to be unsuccessfully returned to them by the opponent. Each player takes turns serving the ball throughout the whole game.</p>
